Our Topic Modeling codes require the users to have both **Mallet** and **GSDMM** prepared in their environments. 
### To use Mallet
*  Make sure you have Java and JDK installed.
*  Download the following zip file: http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/dist/mallet-2.0.8.zip and unzip it
*  Set a System Environment Variable `MALLET_HOME` as the path to the folder _mallet-2.0.8_
*  Change the `mallet_path` in the _1_lda_analysis_ file in this folder to correspond to the path to Mallet's _bin_ folder.

### To use GSDMM 
* Run this command to clone the folder into the current directory: `git clone https://github.com/rwalk/gsdmm.git`
